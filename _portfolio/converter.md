The GSC Converter was named after its creators: Gaju, Seun and Carl-Michel. It was made for the nit-picky programmers that prefer a certain coding naming convention and we focused mainly on camelCase and under_score. This utility tool allows programmers to switch from one naming convention to the other. This is especially convenient when youâ€™re collaborating with other programmers and you prefer one naming convention to the other.

This tool earned us second place in a hackathon organized by the Linux User Group (LUG) Group. It was an opportunity for us get more practice in C; a language we had only been exposed to for 2 weeks. Furthermore, it was my first time contributing to open source. I would like to warn anyone interested in using this that the tool works at about 80%, we only had two days to work on it as part of the hackathon. However, if you would like to improve it, click the [link to the repo](https://github.com/DavidOdun/GSCConventionConverter) and be my guest!
