Conway’s Game of Life was the first project I ever worked on that made me go through all the frustrating emotions that come with creating something as a first year computer science student. I could swear that I had never worked so hard and focus for so long on one single thing. However, I also remember the ecstasy and rush of overwhelming happiness that surged my body once I got it working! After that project I was told myself “Yeah, I kinda like this computer science.” I’m not sure why this particular project made things click for me but it did.  

For those who don’t know what Conway’s Game of Life, let me lay it down for you. There are 4 rules:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

With those rules in mind, the user gets to pick the initial state of the live cells and see how they progress to the next generation. If you are strategic enough to create the right initial state, the game of life can continue on forever.
