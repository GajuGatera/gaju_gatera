As a final project for our Data Structure's class, my teammates and I opted for a task scheduler designed for students to prioritize better they tasks. This was inspired by everyone's hectic schedule as a CS major - especially considering everyone in our group was either a double major or trying to cram a 4 year degree in 3 years.

Our task scheduler is considered special because it not only takes into account the tasks it's given but also the dependencies each task has with the other. We managed to do so with our own "TwoSort" algorithm inspired by the traditional Topological Sort algorithm we learned about in data structures. 

Here is a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcMEfqkK_BM) of our algorithm working.
