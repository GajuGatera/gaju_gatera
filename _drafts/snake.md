There a lot of snake game repos in the world and for most people, including myself, the snake game was the first game I every coded. My friend Erin and I thought it would be cool to create a snake game with the snake represented as a linked list. Back then we knew very little about linked lists and let's just say that our game was not very impressive. 

I've decided to redeem myself and create a better snake game. This one was especially creative for me because I went on instagram and asked people to suggest features they'd like to add to my snake game. In a way it was a collective effort. I'll share the end result very soon as I have to still add some features that were extremely original and in all honesty quite challenging to figure out.
