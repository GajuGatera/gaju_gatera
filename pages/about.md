Technology was something that was introduced to me quite early in life although I did not recognize it as such at the time. I got pulled into photography because I was interested in the way a camera worked. It was not until I actually learned the history of cameras and where they come from that I went out and shot my first photo. Similarly, I never liked reading until I first got my hand on Kindle and was fascinated by how a little piece of tech could hold so many books at once.

Eventually, the first year of university, I get introduced to computer science and that was like opening Pandora's box. What can you NOT do with computer science? At first, I thought it was magic because the definition of a computer scientist is someone that solves problems - any problem! Once I grasped that, I had realized that solving problems was something that I want to pursue for the rest of my life. I am currently doing a bachelor’s degree Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, as well as a degree in Computer Science. I am also very excited to start my summer 2019 internship at Microsoft as a Program Manager. I know for a fact that this internship will allow me to finally apply all my skills to create/produce something useful and hopefully solve someone’s problem.

The point of this website is to share my journey with technology. Whether that presents itself in a coding project or photography that I’ve been working on. This website is built with Jekyll and it was my chance to dive into web development. I like to think that by sharing my story I can inspire others - especially women of color - to follow this path.
